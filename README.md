# AgileForMe
# Artifacts
	1. Product Backlogs  - Product Goal - comprehensive user stories list
	2. Sprint Backlog - Sprint Goal.
	3. Project burn down chart 
	4. Increment - Definition of Done - outcome of a sprint.
	
# Capacity Planning - Team of 5-10. Calculate all available time. Shared Architect.
# Spike Story - Not a shippable feature. Like a  R&D items that cannot be delivered.
# User Story - Potentially Shippable.
# Velocity - speed/time ..Rate of efficiency like 90% achieved in sprint-1, 92% in sprint-2.
# Scrum Ceremonies : Sprint planning, daily scrum(15 mins), sprint review(on the last day of sprint), demo to owner the potential shippable items (done/not-done), Retrospect - like lessons learnt(what went well, What went wrong, impediments, concerns, callouts).
# In daily scrums we use RAID - RISK, Assumptions/Actions, Issues, Dependencies/Decisions. What is the impact- delivery delay, root cause, who is going to resolve that. Raise these in Risk register like JIRA.
# Story point - size of a user story.
# Smallest user story is 1 day.

# Duration of sprint is TIMEBOXED.
	
# Sprint Goal --> Product Goal -->Product vision
	
# Commitment 
    Dedicated to achieving something specific

# Inspection
    Check if the product development is in the right direction. Change the course if needed is called Adaptation

# Back Log:
	1. Product -Something that customers use and get some benefit. In scrum it is called Benefit
	2. Product Backlog - accumulation of unfinished work. This needs to be ordered.
		a. Details
		b. Size - Sizing/Estimation
		c. Order
	3. Risk --Let's say Leave for vacation goal
	4. Dependency - finding a destination
	5. Refinement : Is that a Back log needs to be continuously improved.
# User Stories - WHO/WHAT/WHY
    EX : As a <Some User>
    I want <Some Objective>
    So that <Some outcome>
# Acceptance Criteria
    Product Back log refinement activity - is an activity where product back logs are added/updated/deleted after discussion between product owner and developers  and to estimate or size the activity.

# Relative Sizing : Approximate estimate
# Actual Sizing : Absolute estimate

# Planning Poker
    group of estimates ex for (0-100) ---2,4,3,5,6,8,10,39,40, and 100
# Sprint Back Log
	1. Sprint Goal - WHY
	2. Plan -HOW
	3. PBI (Product Back Log Item) --WHAT
# Definition of Done (DOD)
    When the acceptance criteria is met , Code Review, Technical Documentation, Functional and non-functional tests are et
# Increment : Is a new version of the product

# Scrum of Scrums - This is level 2  PSM.
	1. At project level one increment is project increment
	2. Two or more increments are called program/product increments
	
# ART
    Agile Release Train. Itâ€™s a release plan for coordination with different teams.
# PERT - Program Evaluation Review Technique.
    (4 * Most likely + 1*Optimistic + 1*Pessimistic)/6
# Scrum framework
    TIME-Box - Maximum duration for an event 
    Velocity - Past performance(Empirical Data)
    Capacity of Sprint - The time the developers have to complete the Task
# Definition of Done (DOD)
    When the acceptance criteria is met , Code Review, Technical Documentation, Functional and non-functional tests are et
# Scrum Board
    To Do/ In-progress/ Done. 
# Sprint Review
     Max 4 Hours for one month Sprint. Is attended by key stake holders only(interested in the outcome of the project). Out of the sprint is demo'ed in this sprint review ceremony. Purpose is to inspect and adapt.
# Sprint Retrospective
    Max duration is 3 hours for one month sprint. Stake holders are not invited as this discussion is around what went wrong etc.
    How was the last print (individuals, tools, processes, DOD)
